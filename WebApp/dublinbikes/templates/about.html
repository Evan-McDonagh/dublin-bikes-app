        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>We are a team of three Computer Science Conversion MSc students - Conor Short, Evan McDonagh and Hannah Barrett. 
            We created this project as part of a Software Engineering assignment. The goal was to develop a web application to display 
            occupancy and weather information for Dublin Bikes. The project involved data collection through JCDecaux API, data storage, 
            the creation of a Flask app and the design of an intuitive, user-friendly UI. In addition, we developed a simple linear 
            regression model to predict the number of available bikes at each station.
